Today I will give some button effects to inspire you. The effects can be seen when hovering on some buttons. All of them are created by CSS Transition with popular and straight forward pseudo-element: *::before* and *::after*

There are two sets of button
- Hover a button to see the background color change from left to right and vise versa
- Hover a button to see the icon behind show up
